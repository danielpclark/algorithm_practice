# Algorithm Practice
Practicing examples from "Introduction to The Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms" by Anany Levitin

I'm following the examples provided in the book.  If pseudo code is presented I
write it in Ruby in the exact same form it is presented.  If only the steps are provided
I implement the steps as I perceive them.  The more general the description the more my
implementation my vary.

All algorithms have Minitest tests written for them.  The tests are written to adhere to
the examples given in the book.  If no example is given then a generic one is researched and made.

# Contribution
I'm very open to receiving tips and new knowledge for any algorithm.  That does not mean I'll
change the code for it.  If the book has pseudo code, then the algorithm will stay as implemented.
